- 👋 Hi, My name is Vanessa Maldonado and I am a Library Media Specialist at an Elementary School in San Diego.
- 👀 I’m been interested in coding since I was in College; when I use to play around with HTML and styling. Boy have things change from how I last remember it. But, I seem to enjoy designing webs. There is just so much information and different languages in the programming world to learn. I am still unsure what I want to do with this knowledge of coding I have now. I enjoy my day job, but wish to teach children about web development. 
- 🌱 I’m am currently learning on building a full stack application. I realize I have a stronger grasp for front end development than back-end developement. 
- Perhaps with time, I will be able to feel less intimidated with all the back-end knowledge as I build more projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in my BootCamp Program and form a support group to be successful in this course.
